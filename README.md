# Semantic Search & Intelligent Q&A System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based application that enables semantic search and intelligent question answering over a collection of research papers.

The system uses Sentence Transformer embeddings, ChromaDB vector search, CrossEncoder re-ranking, and the Llama 3.2 model (via Ollama) to retrieve relevant information and generate accurate answers.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeevan-003/Semantic_QA_System.git

cd Semantic_QA_System
```

---

### Create Virtual Environment

Windows

```bash
python -m venv myenv

myenv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Install Ollama

Download Ollama

https://ollama.com/download

Pull the model

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

---

## Preparing the Dataset

Place all research papers inside

```
data/raw/
```

---

## Build the Vector Database

```bash
python build_database.py
```

---

## Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Example Questions

- What is Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia?
- Which dataset was used?
- What optimizer was used?
- Explain EfficientNet.
- Which model achieved the highest accuracy?

---

## Evaluation

The system includes Precision@K evaluation.

Precision@K is calculated as

```
Precision@K = Relevant Retrieved Documents / Total Retrieved Documents
```

The evaluation compares retrieved research papers against manually identified relevant papers.
